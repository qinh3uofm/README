# How to Host resume online
--------------------------------------------

## Purpose: 

- Describe the practical steps of how to host and format my resume using Markdown, Visual studio code, GitHub Pages, and Jekyll.  

- Relate the practical steps described above to the general principles of current Technical Writing, as explained in Andrew Etter's book Modern Technical Writing 

---------------------------------------------


## Prerequisites:
You can find my resume [here](https://qinh3uofm.github.io/Resume).

Here is a demo:

## How I write my resume using Etter's protocol:

### 1.Don't Write 
As technical writers, we need to know the goal of our audiences and spend most of our time finding the best way to achieve it. Telling audiences how to achieve their goals should take less than 10% of our time in the process of "Writing". When writing my resume, I spend most of my time getting information about the company I am interested in and the requirement of the specific job I apply to. After I get a broad idea of what kind of information the employees want to see on my resume, I will modify my resume according to that.

### 2.Define the Audience
To show audiences our appealing resume, we need to know what knowledge our audiences have. In this case, I assume my audiences have internet access and know-how to use the GitHub page to see my resume hosting there.

### 3.Basic Functional Documentation
By making my resume target specific jobs, I make sure all the information contained in it is what my audience wants to see.

### 4.Style
In Etter's book, he mentioned for a good technical writing style, writers should provide consistency of words, proper headers, images, and use inline style to offset important text. I use consistent words in my resume, every part of the resume has a unique header, and all of the important information is in bold.

### 5.Catalog the Diff
Etter believes record changes to a product are one of the most important functions of a technical writer. Good change logs convince people to upgrade, inspire confidence in the direction of a product, and help developers take advantage of new features. Before I make changes to my resume, I create a new branch on my repository first, after I have down all the changes I merge the new branch to the main branch and commit it.

### 6.Build a Website
Building and hosting a website is necessary for modern technical writing, PDFs and other documentation goes out of date and becomes stale as time goes by. A newer version might be better but the modern web browser does not overwrite the old files. By hosting a website all the information is synced quickly thus information provided there is up to date.

### 7. Help Others Write
By using Github Page, everyone can see my resume website and commit changes to it. Any help is appreciated since my resume might have a large space for improvement that I am not aware of.

### 8.Publish Frequently
Publishing is very easy using Github Page, just commit your code then click commit changes then you are good to go. In a few minutes, you can see your newly published website.

## FAQs:
1. **Why is Markdown better than a word processor?**


Markdown gets rid of complicated buttons of Microsoft word; more importantly, you do not even need a mouse when writing a Markdown file. All the modification of format is done by keyboard using simple instruction which is easy to learn in less than an hour. It saves a lot of time for the advanced writer who is familiar with Markdown files. 


2. **Why is my resume not showing up?**


It might take a few minutes for your resume to show up due to internet latency. If it still does not show up, you might want to check if you put your resume in the right repositories named 'yourusername'.github.io and make sure the resume is in the main branch as default. The resume needs to be an HTML or markdown file
